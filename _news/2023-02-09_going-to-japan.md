David and I are excited to let you all know that we are going to return to Japan after traveling there more than 7 years ago! We are so excited and cannot wait to visit parts of Japan that we missed during our first time there. And, of course, we are also looking forward to seeing Kaz, Allie, and Lucy! It's been way too long!
