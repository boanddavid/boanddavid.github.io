### Bo ("the Webmaster")

David and I met during university at a LGBT meetup for science and engineering students on September 24, 2012. We hit it off right away and started dating, and the rest is history. David is the sweetest and smartest guy I have ever known. Despite his tall stature, he is actually the more tender hearted one in our relationship, so I was not surprised at all when he chose to become a psychiatrist after medical school. He is extremely well read and is practically the walking encyclopedia of the family. We celebrated our tenth anniversary together last year on our honeymoon. Looking back the last decade of us being together, I felt so lucky to have spent it with the love of my life - David.

### David ("the Editor")
