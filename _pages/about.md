**Bo ("the Webmaster")**: David and I met during university at a LGBT meetup for science and engineering students on September 24, 2012. We hit it off right away and started dating, and the rest is history. David is the sweetest and smartest guy I have ever known. Despite his tall stature, he is actually the more tender hearted one in our relationship, so I was not surprised at all when he chose to become a psychiatrist after medical school. He is extremely well read and is practically the walking encyclopedia of the family. We celebrated our 10th anniversary together last year on our honeymoon. Looking back the last decade of us being together, I feel so lucky to have spent it with him, and I cannot wait to experience life with him on our many adventures to come.

**David ("the Editor")**: Bo and I have had lots of adventures over the last decade: moving in together, being long distance during Bo's masters, moving across the country and back in together; travelling the world together; supporting each other through through new jobs and everyday chores; celebrating the milestones of our wedding and honeymoon. I've loved to watch Bo tinker with his server and Raspberry Pi's and catch shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go, find good deals with him at the grocery store, and go for evening walks together. Throughout it all, I've appreciated Bo's playful sense of humor, his conscientious and attentive problem-solving, and the ways he shows care for his family and friends. I can't wait to see what's in store together!
